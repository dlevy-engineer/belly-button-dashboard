# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 submission for UC Berkeley data science bootcamp.

## Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) from the Rob Dunn Lab, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
